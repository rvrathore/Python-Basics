Python is a popular high-level programming language used for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, and data analysis. Here are some basics of Python:

*1 - Variables and Data Types: In Python, you can create variables to store data such as numbers, strings, and boolean values.
a = 10  # integer
b = "Hello, World!"  # string
c = True  # boolean

*2 - Operators: Python supports various operators such as arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.
# Arithmetic operators
x = 10
y = 5
print(x + y)  # 15
print(x - y)  # 5
print(x * y)  # 50
print(x / y)  # 2.0

# Assignment operators
x += y  # equivalent to x = x + y

# Comparison operators
x == y  # False
x != y  # True
x > y   # True
x < y   # False
# Logical operators
x and y  # True
x or y   # True
not x    # False

*3 - Control Structures: Python provides various control structures such as if-else statements, for loops, and while loops.
# if-else statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
# for loop
for i in range(1, 5):
    print(i)
# while loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    
*4 - Functions: You can define functions in Python to reuse code and make it more modular.
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  

*5 - Libraries: Python has a vast collection of libraries that provide additional functionality. For example, NumPy is a library for scientific computing, pandas is a library for data analysis, and Flask is a library for web development.
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(x.mean())
